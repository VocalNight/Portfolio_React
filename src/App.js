        Hi i'm Victor, i program things and fix bugs.
        I'm used to both front-end and back end, but really enjoy the back end side of things in systems.

        Projects done:

        CSharp 
        Console projects i made while learning C#. I'm revisiting them and adding new things as i learn more about the language.
        
        Csharp + React
        Csharp + Angular
        MVC

        Projects in the pipeline


        Laravel
        I'm learning Laravel and PHP! For that i'm building a small bugtracker for my personal use and plan to add to it over time, so this one will be in progress for a good while, but you are free to check it out.

        // Cards for each project

        
      </header>

     


    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
